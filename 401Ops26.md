# Ops Challenge: Event Logging Tool Part 1 of 3

## Overview

Logging system events for response and/or analysis is a major part of security operations. Logs create accountability and also provide signals to build automation systems around. With proper logging and monitoring, a SOC team can respond quickly and appropriately as events unfold.

Today you will begin incorporating logging capabilities into one of your existing Python tools.

## Resources
- [Python Logging Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial)
- [What Are stdin, stdout, and stderr on Linux?](https://www.howtogeek.com/435903/what-are-stdin-stdout-and-stderr-on-linux/)
- [Logging Module in Python](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/logging-module-in-python/)

## Requirements

First, visit [Python Logging Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial) and practice the Basic Logging Tutorial.

Next, review terminology at [What Are stdin, stdout, and stderr on Linux?](https://www.howtogeek.com/435903/what-are-stdin-stdout-and-stderr-on-linux/) before visiting [Logging Module in Python](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/logging-module-in-python/) for some examples to get you started.

By now, you will have created several Python scripts in your public repo. Select one of your Python tools created during this class so far that does not have a logging feature. On that tool:

- Add logging capabilities to your Python tool using the logging library.
- Experiment with log types. Build in some error handling, then induce some errors. Send log data to a file in the local directory.
- Confirm your logging feature is working as expected.
## Submission
- When you are ready to submit your script for grading, copy your script to a new file in your public Github repository. Name the file according to your course code and assignment, e.g. ops-401d1: Challenge 01.
- Copy the URL to your GitHub file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A question within the context of today’s lab assignment
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment
    - How long you spent working on this assignment
